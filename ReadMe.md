### Basic Rust Syntax Stuff

Just getting familiar with some syntax. What will you find here? Not a lot of interesting stuff. Just how to use functions, enums, structs, vectors, some basic string manipulation in rust. 

### Tech

Tech uses the very very very advanced terminal shell and cargo compiler.

### Run the File
```
$ cargo run
```
